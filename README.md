# GPU-Finder
This script checks the best buy website and sends a text message to the subscriber if one of the specified units is in stock
It specifically is looking for the "Add to Cart" button or an "Out of Stock" button to see what units are in and out of stock

Setup

Environment Variables
 - You will need a phone number that can receive texts
 - You will need to create a Twilio acocunt
 - You will want to store these as environment variables
 
Web URLs
 - You will want to use Best Buy URLs that have only the products you are interested in
 - Best Buy URLs reflect any filters you may apply on their website, so I encourate the use of price filters, manufacturer filters, etc. to get what you're looking for
